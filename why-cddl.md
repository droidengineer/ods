The [Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php) has been selected by the OSSCC as the best choice for a reciprocal license.

##OSI compliance
The CDDL is a fully OSI compliant license.

##License type
The CDDL is a reciprocal license. with a strong Copyleft

## The CDDL and Copyright Woes
The CDDL has been designed to be compliant to the US Copyright law and to the European Copytight law.

Other design goals have been to create a license that is less burdensome, easier to read and understand and more consistent in terms of language. The CDDL also fixed a problem with reusability in the MPL. In addition, the CDDL enhanced the patent peace provisions. The CDDL is one of few OSS licenses where the community did really influence the content of the license. This caused the CDDL to become usable equally for companies and for individuals. 

##Patents

The CDDL gives patent grants and it contains rules that help to defend against patent trolls. In terms of patent grant, CDDL provides explicit patent license which would make it easier for businesses to use the software without worries around patents. There is also a provision to discourage patent litigation also referred to as the “patent peace” provision which is about termination of rights in response to patent claims. If anyone initiates a patent claim that involves CDDL software, all rights which they have received to the software from everyone in the community is terminated.

Further the CDDL has a patent MAD clause (see 6.2 of the CDDL), if a user should sue a contributor for patent infringement in their contribution to the CDDL covered work, the litigating party loses all rights granted to them under the CDDL by contributors. Or to put it another way: the community of users of and contributors to a CDDL project are each bound, at pain of losing all rights granted to them by the CDDL to that software, to not sue each other for patent infringement regarding contributions to that software. Ie, to use the software of a CDDL project, you have to leave your patent-litigation club at the door. 

##The CDDL in collaborative works
The CDDL license allows code flow from and to CDDL licensed projects into projects under a different license. CDDL licensed code may be incorporated into any other work as long as the code is not merged within a single file. CDDL code needs to be in files containing CDDL licensed code only, but the CDDL does not disallow to combine with code under different licenses in a single work.

CDDL is flexible in that it allows mixing of CDDL open source files with files licensed differently, including proprietary source files. This flexibility allows licensing new IP created in new files differently and even with a non-open source license. This could be useful in situations where we have third party code that cannot be open sourced and should remain proprietary or we wish to work with the open source base and build some custom extensions.

For these reasons, the CDDL is the license of choice for us and our open source projects.
